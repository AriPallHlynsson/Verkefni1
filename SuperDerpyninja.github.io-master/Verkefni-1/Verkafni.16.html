<o style="color:black;text-align: left">Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has<br>
been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer<br>
took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not<br>
only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially<br> 
unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing<br>
Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus<br> 
PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.<br>
